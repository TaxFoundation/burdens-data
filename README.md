# State and Local Tax Burdens in Nominal Dollars from 1977 to 2011

These data accompany the Tax Foundation's report [Annual State-Local Tax Burden Rankings](http://taxfoundation.org/burdens). They are the product of analyzing data from government and public policy sources. This report estimates the combined state and local tax burden shouldered by the residents of each of the fifty states, regardless of the jurisdictions to which those taxes are paid. The burden is calculated as the total taxes paid by state residents to any tax jurisdiction divided by the per capita income of that state.
